# Face Generation

Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree Program Project to use generate new faces from [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset using Deep Convolutional GAN network.

# Project Overview

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

\- [Udacity Project Repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation)

# Result

30 epochs - depth = 128

- facial features are not fully defined
- pixelated faces

30 epochs - depth = 256

- facial features are mostly defined for majority of the faces
- still pixelated faces

100 epochs - depth = 128

- facial features are mostly defined for majority of the faces
- less pixelated faces
